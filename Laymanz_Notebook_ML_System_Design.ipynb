    "In this notebook, we will go over some of the most common fundamental ideas in ML system design. We want these notebooks to be dense and concise. There will be interactive examples, coding exercises and a final challenge made just for you to set you up for success in the later notebooks!\n",

    "All of our notebooks will only use numpy, pytorch, matplotlib for visualizations. If you are very eager to learn about what PyTorch is and how it works, check out this super detailed notebook on PyTorch! If you are running this on colab you can just import the packages, if you are running this notebook locally , just remember to `pip install numpy torch matplotlib`. Check [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to see which torch version depending on the hardware you have.\n",

    "ML systems learn complex patterns from existing data and use these patterns to make predictions on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use ML:\n",
    "1) When the system has the capacity to learn, when there is data for it to learn (i.e. predicting rental prices of AirBnB places)\n",
    "2) When there are complex patterns to learn (stock prices, crypto prices, object detection, speech recognition)\n",
    "    - Traditional software: Inputs, Pattern -> output\n",
    "    - ML: Inputs, Outputs -> pattern\n",
    "3) There is data and you can collect it\n",
    "    - you need ML algos to learn from data\n",
    "    - zero shot learning: use an ML system  \n",
    "    - continual learning: deploy a model and learn from incomign data in production\n",
    "4) Its a prediction problem\n",
    "    - make approximations with ML\n",
    "5) Unseen data share patterns with training data\n",
    "    - temporal relevancy of the data is very important (data from 10 years ago vs rn)\n",
    "    - you can make assumtions about user behaviour\n",
    "6) Its repetitive \n",
    "    - if it is repetitive there should be a pattern to be learnt from it\n",
    "7) Cost of wrong predictions is cheap\n",
    "    - wrong predictions wont have catastrophic consequences\n",
    "8) Can be scaled\n",
    "    - can make a lot of predictions (inferences) at the same time\n",
